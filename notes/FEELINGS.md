I'm sharing tql here for reference, btw: https://github.com/trentbrew/tql

And here is code-hq (a project-scoped knowledge graph system designed for agentic development workflows. It combines TQL's powerful EAV query engine with opinionated conventions for project management, creating a semantic memory layer that both humans and AI agents can read, write, and reason over.
): https://github.com/trentbrew/code-hq

CodeHQ is the proof. I use it evveryday and it has increased my velocity by nearly 400% and has been integral in maintaining alignment with coding agents for complex projects and large code-bases. That's a real, measurable success in my book, considering it was built to solve my own challenges with agentic development. It's been invaluable.

After experiencing these gains from code-hq and having validated the power of TQL, I immediately tried building several other PKMs: (1) a personal lifeOS / second brain simiilar to notion (2) a project-aware team of agents to help with marketing, branding, and fundraising. The more I would build out thesee systems, the more I realized they are all effectively trying to achieve the same goal and depend on much of the same data. Instead of dulicating the same data/logic across many PKMs, I decided this FileGraph system would be the best way to merge everything under the same roof, while also making progress toward a dream of mine to build the first ai-native graph-based OS that treats the system like a mind instead of a cubicle.

That said, _I_ want this to exist and I'm not too concerned with whether anyone else wants it to exist.

Pushback is encouraged. I tend to build things I need and if other people find it useful that's a nice bonus. Maybe I ought to want other pepole to realize they couldnt live without something before it was presented to them. I'm still learning, so pushback is always welcomed.
